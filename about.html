<h3 id="education-summary">Education Summary</h3>
<p>I am currently a PhD student in Computing and Information Science program at <a href="https://www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> since 2017 Fall.
I am working in <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/">Document and Pattern Recognition Lab</a> with my advisor <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/">Richard Zanibbi</a> in Department of Computer Science at RIT.</p>
<p>My interests is primarily in math-aware search engine or mathematical information retrieval and also front-end development.</p>
<p>I received my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (advised by Professor <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/">Fang Hui</a>) from University of Delaware,
and B.S. degree from Jiliang University of China, in 2015 and 2013 respectively.</p>
