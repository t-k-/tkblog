### Education Summary 
I am currently a PhD student in Computing and Information Science program at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu) since 2017 Fall.
I am working in [Document and Pattern Recognition Lab](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/) with my advisor [Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/) in Department of Computer Science at RIT.

My interests is primarily in math-aware search engine or mathematical information retrieval, machine learning and also WEB development.

I received my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (advised by Professor [Fang Hui](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/)) from University of Delaware,
and B.S. degree from Jiliang University of China, in 2015 and 2013 respectively.

Due to global pandemic, I am unable to continue my research at RIT and I am currently looking for an internship or fulltime job, please contact me via E-mail: wxz8033@rit.edu

### Side Projects
* \[ [Approach0](https://approach0.xyz/docs/) \]: A Math-aware search engine combining math expression and regular keywords search.
	* Ranked #1 by highest votes in [2020 Math Stack Exchange Community Promotion Ads](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31296/community-promotion-ads-2020/31299#31299).
	* We are able to obtain the state-of-the-art accuracy with best efficiency among all known public math search engines.
* \[ [tinynn](https://github.com/borgwang/tinynn) \]: A lightweight (educational) deep learning library. I contribute many parts of the code, including: Denoising autoencoder (DAE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine with CD-k training and activation maximization (AM) visualization.
* \[ [tkcloud](https://github.com/t-k-cloud) \]: A home-hosted "cloud" system I use daily.
	* I use it to backup my data automatically, remotely access my home-hosted storage drive and expose many other useful Web services.
	* One of the repository [listify](https://github.com/t-k-cloud/listify) is using Vue/Webpack to create a generic framework to view or edit my news/blog feeds, todo list and schedules.
