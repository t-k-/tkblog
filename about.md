### Education Summary 
I am currently a PhD student in Computing and Information Science program at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu) since 2017 Fall.
I am working in [Document and Pattern Recognition Lab](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/) with my advisor [Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/) in Department of Computer Science at RIT.

My interests is primarily in math-aware search engine or mathematical information retrieval and also front-end development.

I received my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (advised by Professor [Fang Hui](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/)) from University of Delaware,
and B.S. degree from Jiliang University of China, in 2015 and 2013 respectively.

I am currently looking for an internship or fulltime job, please contact me via E-mail: wxz8033@rit.edu

### Working Experience
* Sep, 2016 ∼ Aug, 2017: Software Developer at Huawei Technologies co. (BrandZ’s Top 100 Global Brands Company, 2015), Shenzheng China.
* Jun, 2015 ∼ Aug, 2015: System developer [internship](https://www.glassdoor.com/Photos/SevOne-Office-Photos-E445891_P5.htm) at SevOne Inc. (2015 Glassdoor best places to work), Wilmington DE, USA.

### Projects
* \[ [Approach0](https://approach0.xyz/demo/) \]: [Open-source](https://github.com/approach0) math-aware search engine combining math expression and regular keywords search. Many [positive feedbacks](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/24978/announcing-a-third-party-search-engine-for-math-stackexchange) have been received from popular math Q&A website.
	* We are able to obtain the state-of-the-art accuracy with best efficiency among all known public math search engines.
	* This project contains more than 20K lines of code, I designed the framework and Makefiles to make development easy and modulized.
* \[ [tkcloud](https://github.com/t-k-cloud) \]: A "cloud" system I use daily, whose storage is hosted at my own bedroom. I use it to backup my data efficiently (wired connection), remote access my data and expose many other Web services of my own.
	* One of the repository [listify](https://github.com/t-k-cloud/listify) is using Vue/Webpack to create a generic framework to view or edit my news/blog feeds, todo list and schedules on calendar.
* \[ [Voice Instead](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-instead/kphdioekpiaekpmlkhpaicehepbkccbf) \]: A TTS (text to speech) Chrome extension with more than 20k weekly users, and it brings me ~50$ per weak. This extension is developed with Vue single file component.

### Skill Set (Name a few)
* C/C++/Makefile
* Linux/Bash script
* CSS/HTML/Javascript/Node.js/Vue/Webpack

### Interesting Projects
* \[ [FlappyBird in VHDL](https://github.com/t-k-/vhdl_flappybird) \]: An interesting course project I made in embedded system course (see [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn5G29TR8y4)!)
* \[ [8-bit TTL‑CPU](https://approach0.xyz/tkblog/entry.php?id=761) \]: Homebrew 8-bit TTL CPU, it successfully runs a *for loop* to calculate *1 + 2 + ... + 19* in Multisim software simulation.
